## Sprint (June 9 & 10, 2021)

### Recommended Working Format

After problems are identified, pick one where you can offer expertise or extensive personal experience, and form a group of 3-4 others who feel the same. In your working group, identify one person who will be the "Synthesizer / Scribe" who will from the very beginning of the work be responsible for writing a well-formatted narrative or clean outline of the content you'd like to publish/share by the end of the sprint. 

### Project Team Accomplishments
Please replace with the tasks you team was able to accomplish during the Sprint event.

The __Duplicates__ subgroup started a [catalog of matching and duplicate rules for common use cases](doc/SampleDuplicateRules.md).

The __Addresses__ subgroup identified address standardization and incomplete addresses as issues to solve and is ready to begin documentation - see project wiki entry https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Data-Integrity-Integrations/wiki/Address-Problem-Identification-and-Solutioning. 

# Past Project Teams
We recommend creating a Wiki page for past Sprint Event volunteers (per Sprint), and that Sprints goals, accomplishments, etc. Here's a good example: https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/DataGenerationToolkit. If you prefer to add this information to the readme file, here's a good example of formatting you can use: https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Admin-Skills-and-Nonprofit-Salesforce-Teams
