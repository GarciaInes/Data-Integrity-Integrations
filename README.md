## Sprint (June 9 & 10, 2021)

### Recommended Working Format

After problems are identified, pick one where you can offer expertise or extensive personal experience, and form a group of 3-4 others who feel the same. In your working group, identify one person who will be the "Synthesizer / Scribe" who will from the very beginning of the work be responsible for writing a well-formatted narrative or clean outline of the content you'd like to publish/share by the end of the sprint. 

### Project Team Accomplishments
After some initial conversation and [brainstorming](doc/InitialTopicBrainstorm.md), the group decided to choose two topics and split into one subgroup for each topic.

The __Duplicates__ subgroup started a [catalog of matching and duplicate rules for common use cases](doc/SampleDuplicateRules.md).

Duplicate solutions - completed but lacking links in Github: Videos, including one on flows

The __Addresses__ subgroup started documenting methods for ensuring address standardization and completeness, including a comparison of NPSP-compatible tools (https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Data-Integrity-Integrations/wiki/Address-Data-Integrity-Documentation). 


# Past Project Teams
We recommend creating a Wiki page for past Sprint Event volunteers (per Sprint), and that Sprints goals, accomplishments, etc. Here's a good example: https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/DataGenerationToolkit. If you prefer to add this information to the readme file, here's a good example of formatting you can use: https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Admin-Skills-and-Nonprofit-Salesforce-Teams

# Project Resources and Documentation
* Documentation can be found in the repository links under accomplishments and in the wiki site https://github.com/SFDO-Community-Sprints/Admin-Skills-and-Nonprofit-Salesforce-Teams
* Power of Us HUB group "Sprint: Data Issues with Integrations: https://powerofus.force.com/s/group/0F97y00000009hdCAA/sprint-data-issues-with-integatrations


# Future Contributions (AKA what were you unable to finish at the Sprint)
Next steps for future sprnts:
* Data Integrity issues related to duplicates: Add the "what" and the "why" and make the documentation more useable so integrations can be managed better
* Data Integrity issues releated to addresses: Complete documention by expanding and refining it, and review all NPSP integration options
